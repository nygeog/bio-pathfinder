# This is a definition file for pathways that are to be divided into modules.
# Each line contains a linear list of compounds which are supposed to be a single step apart (according to the EC list),
# i.e. there exists a single enzyme that can make A(i) into A(i+1).
# Note that the @ sign at the beginning of a line, means the program will take chirality into account (and include epimerases in the EC list)
